# Active Progress

- 🔄 Localized `WalletConnectAuth` via new `web3/auth` namespace; added locale-aware redirects, embedded variant support, and translated status/messages.
- 🌐 Extended `Web3` auth components (`WalletConnector`, `WalletRegistration`) to use the shared namespace with en/zh/ja copy, localized toasts/errors, and consistent safety messaging.
- 🧭 Localized the reusable `WalletConnectButton` menu/redirects and legacy login toggles in `AuthPageClient` to rely on `web3/auth` translations + locale-aware routing.
- 📊 Localized Web3 dashboard flows (`Web3Integration`, `WagmiWalletConnector`, `Web3SmartContractInteraction`) using `web3/auth` strings for check-in UI, contract stats, and toasts across en/zh/ja.
- ℹ️ Basic remember-me preference stored in `localStorage` (`astrozi_login_remember` / `_email`) to prefill future visits.
- 💱 `Web3PointsDisplay` now sources the configurable BNB→USD rate (via `PricingManager`), formats the USD equivalent with the active locale, and pushes the points shop CTA through the localized router.
- 🪙 `Web3PointsDisplaySimple` adopts shared translations for the totals card and uses locale-aware compact number formatting.

# Next Step

- Continue Task 4.3 by internationalizing the remaining Web3 analytics surfaces—`PointsShop` and `FortuneGallery` still need translation coverage, locale-aware routing, and price messaging review.
